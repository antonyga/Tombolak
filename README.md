A random task generator

While studying to gain experience and become a professional software developer I frequently struggled to keep a steady progress and practice everyday. 
I also have problems to memorize syntax or long functions (but knew exactly what I needed to solve the problem). So I decided to make an app to generate random tasks to study. 

The goal of this app is to generate a random task in order to study / practise them and become a better developer.

The user can upload a list of tasks in .csv format and the app will randomly choose a task for study.

Enjoy!
